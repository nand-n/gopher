# Hash Algorithm 
It is a mathematical function that takes in a variable-sized inputs such as a file or message , and produces a fixed-size output , known as a hash or digest. 

 The Out put is unique representation of the input data and even a small chang eto the input data will produce a complately d/t hash value 

Hash algorithms are designed to be one-way funcitons , means extremely difficult(if not impossible) to reconstruct the orginal inut data form the hash values. 

- MD5 
- SHA-1 
- SHA-2 
- SHA-3 are some examples of hashing algorithms
